# Breaking the Monolith

## SWAPI Proxy

In this second live coding section, we're going to build upon what we've covered in our [GraphQL introduction](https://github.com/mikamai/codemotion-ws-breaking-the-monolith/tree/apollo-introduction) and create a GraphQL API that proxies the notorious [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co).

In particular, we are reproducing three top level endpoints:

- https://swapi.co/api/films/
- https://swapi.co/api/people/
- https://swapi.co/api/planets/
